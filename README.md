**SSO Profile - the Department for International Trade (DIT) service for managing EIG profiles.**


## Development

Read the [Developers Onboarding Checklist](https://uktrade.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ED/pages/32243946/Developers+onboarding+checklist)

The back-end framework is Django 1.9. The front-end uses minimal Javascript. The motivation for this is for accessibility reasons, to reduce technical complexity, and reduce cross-browser compatibility issues. Therefore most front-end work will be HTML and SASS/CSS development.

We aim to follow [GDS service standards](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) and [GDS design principles](https://www.gov.uk/design-principles).

## Requirements
[Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-391/)

[Redis]( https://redis.io/)

### SASS
We use SASS CSS pre-compiler. If you're doing front-end work your local machine will also need the following dependencies:

[node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

[SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)

## Running locally

### Installing
    $ git clone https://github.com/uktrade/directory-sso-profile
    $ cd directory-sso-profile
    $ virtualenv .venv -p python3.6
    $ source .venv/bin/activate
    $ make install_requirements

### Additional step on OSX

A recent update to OSX removed a particular method from python around SSL. This will cause Captcha to fail in development. This can be re-installed by running the following in terminal: '/Applications/Python\ 3.6/Install\ Certificates.command'. Please read https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27835619/urllib-and-ssl-certificate-verify-failed-error for a more detailed explanation.

### Configuration

Secrets such as API keys and environment specific configurations are placed in `conf/env/secrets-do-not-commit` - a file that is not added to version control. To create a template secrets file with dummy values run `make secrets`.

### Commands

| Command                       | Description |
| ----------------------------- | ------------|
| make clean                    | Delete pyc files |
| make pytest                   | Run all tests |
| make pytest test_foo.py       | Run all tests in file called test_foo.py |
| make pytest -- --last-failed` | Run the last tests to fail |
| make pytest -- -k foo         | Run the test called foo |
| make pytest -- <foo>          | Run arbitrary pytest command |
| make flake8                   | Run flake8 linting |
| make checks                   | Run black, isort, flake8 in check mode |
| make autoformat               | Run black and isort in file-writing mode |
| make manage <foo>             | Run arbitrary management command |
| make webserver                | Run the development web server |
| make requirements             | Compile the requirements file |
| make install_requirements     | Installed the compile requirements file |
| make css                      | Compile scss to css |
| make secrets                  | Create your secret env var file |

## CSS development

If you're doing front-end development work you will need to be able to compile the SASS to CSS. For this you need:

    $ npm install  # to install yarn
    $ yarn install # use yarn for installing all other javascript dependencies

We add compiled CSS files to version control. This will sometimes result in conflicts if multiple developers are working on the same SASS files. However, by adding the compiled CSS to version control we avoid having to install node, npm, node-sass, etc to non-development machines.

You should not edit CSS files directly, instead edit their SCSS counterparts.

## Session

Signed cookies are used as the session backend to avoid using a database. We therefore must avoid storing non-trivial data in the session, because the browser will be exposed to the data.

## SSO
To make sso work locally add the following to your machine's `/etc/hosts`:

| IP Adress | URL                  |
| --------  | -------------------- |
| 127.0.0.1 | buyer.trade.great    |
| 127.0.0.1 | supplier.trade.great |
| 127.0.0.1 | sso.trade.great      |
| 127.0.0.1 | api.trade.great      |
| 127.0.0.1 | profile.trade.great  |
| 127.0.0.1 | exred.trade.great    |

Then log into `directory-sso` via `sso.trade.great:8004`, and use `directory-sso-profile` on `profile.trade.great:8006`

Note in production, the `directory-sso` session cookie is shared with all subdomains that are on the same parent domain as `directory-sso`. However in development we cannot share cookies between subdomains using `localhost` - that would be like trying to set a cookie for `.com`, which is not supported by any RFC.

Therefore to make cookie sharing work in development we need the apps to be running on subdomains. Some stipulations:
 - `directory-sso-profile` and `directory-sso` must both be running on sibling subdomains (with same parent domain)
 - `directory-sso` must be told to target cookies at the parent domain.
